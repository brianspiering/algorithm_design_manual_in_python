The Algorithm Design Manual (3rd ed.) in Python
============

[The Algorithm Design Manual (3rd Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Computer-Science/dp/3030542556) by Steven S. Skiena is a seminal book in computer science. Skiena choose C as the programming language in the book. This repository is a Python version of the algorithms from the book.

[algorist.com](https://www.algorist.com/) is the official website for the book.

Design Principles
------

- Built-in Python only - Use only built-in Python. No imports from Standard Library. No third-party dependencies.
- Readability counts - The code should be as clear as possible, even at the expense of optimizations. 
- Pythonic - Write the algorithms with common idioms of Python. Not a direct translation of the C code.
- Correctness - Write unit tests to confirm the algorithm does what it intends to do (to some degree).
